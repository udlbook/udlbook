Actually, the convention is (weirdly) that this has dilation one.  And when there is one space between the elements, this is dilation two.   This notebook reflects the correct convention and so will be out of sync with the printed book.  If this is confusing, check the [errata](https://github.com/udlbook/udlbook/blob/main/UDL_Errata.pdf) document."
