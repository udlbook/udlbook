You won't learn it by just listening to lectures or reading books.  It really helps to interact with it and explore yourself. <br><br> Work through the cells below, running each cell in turn.  In various places you will see the words **\"TODO\"**. Follow the instructions at these places and write code to complete the functions.  There are also questions interspersed in the text.\n",
